- 👋 Hi, I’m @Remember2fart
- 👀 I’m interested in maintaining open source search engines
That are not currently entangled in the tentacles of the oppressers
Of the technocratic authoritarians like Google, duckduckgo and everyone else
Who has just so eagerly jumped onto the bandwagon of orwellian oppression to
Limit free speech. My goal is to keep an open source search engine on the
internet alive Where everyone can still feel free to search for anything 
they wish to lean about, without the fear of being fed constant propaganda
From big tech oligarchs. My goal is to have a place free from government overreach 
and special interest groups who are constantly Grasping for straws to brainwash 
the user with censored searches and biased media.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that search engine companies do but have your best interest
In mind and their CEO's have absolutely committed treason not only against the United States
But have have committed treasonous Acts against her people as well as crimes against humanity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone else who still believes in the constitution.
- 📫 How to reach me if you are good at this, you will know where to find me. My work can be seen
Every single day all over the world in every country. I'm not only working for the the injuries untied States
But for all of humanity.
